Hi..

This is a batch-job to replace one soc with another soc.

The records are first loaded into the table ninjateam.hgu_tmp_trans....

+---------------+---------------+
| NAME          | Type          |
+---------------+---------------+
| SUBSCRIBER_NO | VARCHAR2(18)  |
| SOC           | VARCHAR2(9)   |
| ACTION        | VARCHAR2(15)  |
| REQUEST_TIME  | DATE          |
| PRIORITY      | NUMBER(1,0)   |
| REQUEST_ID    | VARCHAR2(30)  |
| MEMO_TEXT     | VARCHAR2(300) |
+---------------+---------------+

Once in that table, they can be loaded into ninjadata.master_transactions
using one of the following two stored procedures:

* ninjateam.hgu_procs.load_master_transactions
  - Loads records using 10 streams, based on a modulo calculation of each msisdn.

* ninjateam.hgu_procs.load_master_transactions_1
  - Loads records using 1 stream. No need for additional processes...

..Regards
..Håkan

           If there are any questions,
           don't hesitate to ask me.
           If I still work at NetCom that is...? ;-)
